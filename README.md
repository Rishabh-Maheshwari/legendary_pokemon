# legendary_pokemon
ANN based classification to predict a pokemon is legendary or not

Legendary Pokémon (伝説のポケモン Densetsu no Pokemon), or Pokémon Illusions (幻のポケモン Phantom Pokémon) are extremely rare and powerful Pokémon that are often associated with legends of creation and/or destruction within their endemic regions.

Due to their power, Legendary Pokémon are often the target of organizations that seek to control or change the world within both the anime and the games; in the latter, thwarting such attempts has been integrated into each game's plot since Generation III.
